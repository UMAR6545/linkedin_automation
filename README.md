# LinkedIn Login Automation with Cypress and Page Object Model
This project demonstrates how to automate login to LinkedIn using Cypress and the Page Object Model. It includes a page object model for the LinkedIn login page and a Cypress test that logs in to LinkedIn using your credentials.

## **Prerequisites**
Before you can run this project, you'll need to have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js
Cypress
You can install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/. Once Node.js is installed, you can install Cypress using the following command:

`npm install cypress --save-dev
`

## Usage
To run the test, first clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/UMAR6545/linkedin-login-automation.git
`

Then, navigate to the project directory and open Cypress:

`cd linkedin-login-automation
`

`npx cypress open
`

This will open the Cypress test runner. From there, you can click on the login.spec.js file to run the test.

## Customization

To customize this project for your own use case, you'll need to modify the LinkedInLoginPage class to match the structure of the LinkedIn login page. You may also need to modify the test to fit your specific credentials and use case.
